# RONEK

**Reduced Order modeling for Non-Equilibrium Kinetics**

---

RONEK is a Python librayr designed for efficient [polyharmonic spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyharmonic_spline). Leveraging GPU acceleration, this implementation excels in performance, making it well-suited for large-scale interpolation tasks.

## Installation

Install RONEK using the following command:

```bash
pip install ronek
```

RONEK has minimal dependencies, requiring only PyTorch and NumPy.
